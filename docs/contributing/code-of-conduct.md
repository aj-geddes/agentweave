# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

### Positive Behaviors

- **Being welcoming** - Making newcomers feel welcome and helping them get started
- **Being collaborative** - Working together toward common goals
- **Being constructive** - Providing helpful, constructive feedback
- **Being empathetic** - Understanding and respecting differing viewpoints and experiences
- **Being professional** - Maintaining professionalism in all interactions
- **Accepting responsibility** - Acknowledging mistakes and learning from them
- **Focusing on what's best** - Prioritizing what's best for the overall community

### Unacceptable Behaviors

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- **Harassment** - The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- **Trolling** - Insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- **Discrimination** - Public or private harassment based on protected characteristics

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, including:

- GitHub repositories (issues, pull requests, discussions)
- Community forums and chat platforms
- Email communications
- Social media interactions
- In-person or virtual events
- Any other community spaces

This Code of Conduct also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Reporting Issues

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please report it by contacting the project team at:

**Email:** conduct@agentweave.io

All reports will be handled with discretion and confidentiality.

### What to Include in a Report

When reporting an incident, please include:

1. **Your contact information** - So we can follow up with you
2. **Details of the incident** - What happened, when, and where
3. **People involved** - Who was involved (if applicable)
4. **Context** - Any additional context that may be relevant
5. **Evidence** - Screenshots, links, or other supporting evidence (if available)

### Confidentiality

All reports will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact:** Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence:** A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact:** A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence:** A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact:** A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence:** A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact:** Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence:** A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Appeals

If you believe you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify the project team at conduct@agentweave.io with a concise description of your grievance. Your appeal will be reviewed by community leaders not involved in the original decision.

## Examples of Positive Contribution

To help illustrate what we mean by positive contribution, here are some examples:

### In Code Reviews

**Good:**
```
This implementation looks solid! I have a suggestion that might improve
performance: consider using a set instead of a list for membership checks
on line 42, since we're doing O(n) lookups in a loop.
```

**Not Acceptable:**
```
This code is terrible. Did you even test this? Use a set, obviously.
```

### In Discussions

**Good:**
```
I understand your concern about the authentication flow. While I see it
differently, your point about the user experience is valid. Could we
explore a middle ground that addresses both security and usability?
```

**Not Acceptable:**
```
That's a ridiculous idea. Anyone who understands security would know
this won't work.
```

### In Issue Reports

**Good:**
```
I encountered an issue with the SPIRE integration. Here's what I tried
and the error I got. I'm happy to provide more details or test potential
fixes if that would help!
```

**Not Acceptable:**
```
This is broken and unusable. The docs are terrible and don't explain
anything. Fix it ASAP.
```

## Community Values

Beyond the formal standards above, we encourage community members to embody these values:

### Collaboration Over Competition

We're all working toward the same goal: building great software. We succeed together, not in competition with each other.

### Learning Over Judgment

Everyone is at a different stage in their learning journey. Instead of judging, help others learn and grow.

### Quality Over Ego

The best idea should win, regardless of who suggests it. Check your ego at the door and focus on what's best for the project.

### Transparency Over Secrecy

Communicate openly about decisions, changes, and challenges. Transparency builds trust.

### Inclusion Over Exclusion

Actively work to include diverse perspectives and make space for new contributors.
